# Smart Hand Glove for Visually Impaired People

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Smart Hand Glove for Blind People** is a low-cost IoT-based assistive wearable device designed to help visually impaired individuals navigate safely and independently. The system integrates multiple sensors and wireless communication modules to provide real-time obstacle detection, hazard alerts, and location tracking.

---

## 🎯 Key Features
- Ultrasonic-based obstacle detection (2–400 cm)
- Emergency alert using push button
- GPS-based real-time location tracking
- Bluetooth communication with mobile application
- Audio/Vibration alerts for user feedback
- Low-cost and wearable design

---

## 🧠 System Architecture
The smart glove uses an Arduino/ESP32 microcontroller to process sensor data and trigger alerts. Detected hazards are communicated to caregivers via Bluetooth and GPS.
